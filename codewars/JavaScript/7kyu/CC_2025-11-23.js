/* Player Contact Manager

You are the Dungeon Master for a public DnD game at your local comic shop and recently you've had some trouble keeping your players' info neat and organized so you've decided to write a bit of code to help keep them sorted!

The goal of this code is to create an array of objects that stores a player's name and contact number from a given string.

The method should return an empty array if the argument passed is an empty string or nil/None/null.

Examples:
player_manager("John Doe, 8167238327, Jane Doe, 8163723827") returns [{player: "John Doe", contact: 8167238327}, {player: "Jane Doe", contact: 8163723827}]
player_manager(nil) returns []
player_manager("") returns []
playerManager("John Doe, 8167238327, Jane Doe, 8163723827") returns [{player: "John Doe", contact: 8167238327}, {player: "Jane Doe", contact: 8163723827}]
playerManager(null) returns []
playerManager("")   returns []
*/

function playerManager(players) {
  if (!players) return [];

  const res = [];
  const arr = players.split(",");

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
    const obj = { player: arr[i].trim(), contact: parseInt(arr[i + 1].trim()) };
    res.push(obj);
  }

  return res;
}
