# Coding challenges

Welcome to the coding challenges repository! Here I post solutions to a variety of coding challenges that I tackle daily as part of my ongoing learning.

## Tech used
- JavaScript

## Structure
- Challenges are organized by a topic or coding challenge platform (e.g. CodeWars, NeetCode)
- In each platform folder challenges can be further sorted into subfolders according to their difficulty ( e.g. '8kyu'/'7kyu'/'6kyu'... for Codewars)
- Each challenge is in a separate file which includes challenge name, descritpiton and solution
