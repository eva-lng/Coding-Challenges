/* Keep Hydrated!

Nathan loves cycling. Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

For example:
time = 3 ----> litres = 1
time = 6.7---> litres = 3
time = 11.8--> litres = 5
*/

function litres(time) {
  return Math.floor(time * 0.5);
}

/* Binary Addition

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.
The binary number returned should be a string.
*/

function addBinary(a,b) {
  return (a + b).toString(2);
